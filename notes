## Candidate Models:
* Logistic Regression
* Linear probability model
* SVM classifier
* Neural Network

## TODO:
* handle missing better
* principle components

## Pre-processing
* remove variables with missing percent greater then 30%
* remove low variance variables
* collapse device info
* collapsew browser version
* replace missing values in factors in training data with level "missing"
* one-hot encode factors
* remove original factors after one-hot encoding
* Replace missing values in training data with column means
* replace missing in test data with mean from training data
* replace missing values in factors in testing data with level "missing"
